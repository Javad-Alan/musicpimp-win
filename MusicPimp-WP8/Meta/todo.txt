System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException: External component has thrown an exception.

bug: state is not properly updated when resuming using FAR
- repro: show the player pivot and let the screen go dark, then resume -> playback is not updated
-- at least when pimp server is playing (websockets)

change logo colors to all-white on the same background in some places

add secondary tile to WP
- that launches MusicBeamer camera
- plays favorite playlist

most/latest/random playlists

play random track, play album, artist, ...

bugs:
- when subsonic is the server and the playback device is local, some tracks cause a SystemException
-- for example AC/DC - Money Talks
- on WP7, Subsonic server playback is not updated properly; the server appears to cache responses after a couple of seconds therefore playback stalls

make the musicbeamer approach the default for adding new endpoints

upload files to musicpimp using backgroundtransferservice

pictures, background, colors

fast application resume

explore telerik controls

gamification:
- become a "champion" of a track by playing it more than anyone else
- easy fun
- hard fun
- people fun
- serious fun

research:
Sockets support in Windows Phone 8

add playlist to azure

NFC:
tap to share the app with NFC and PublishURI... API
tap to play music on another NFC device

background transfer considerations: use range requests to support resume 
- incompatibility with subsonic not resolved, lame constraints when the file is >5MB, bad API
- difficult to download & stream simultaneously, tempfile needs to go to shared/transfers, then be moved
- Downloading a file over 5 MB from Subsonic fails with:
"The http network provider returned an error related to content-range request or response"

WP8 policies:

The content-length header is required on the server side for files greater than 5 MB. 
Servers should always return the content-length in responses. 
Failing to do so can result in severely degraded transfer performance.

Range headers are required on the server side for files greater than 5 MB. 
Servers should always support range request headers. 
Failing to do so can result in severely degraded transfer performance.

abandoned:

taglib to read mp3 metadata:
- the library is incompatible with WP8: class Tag extends ICloneable which is not available in WP8
-- this fails at runtime at the latest

read duration of local mp3:
- taglib does not work on WP8
- id3.net duration parser is slow and buggy
- solution: use MediaElementExtensions.TrackDuration(...)

---

design:

appbar
- play/enqueue

settings
- idv3 / directory-based results

--- 

implementation:

starting playback:
user clicks play -> Playlist.SetPlaylist() -> PlayIndex(0)
PlayIndex(0): skipTo(0) -> playPlaylist()
local playPlaylist(): ... -> PlayerControl.SetTrack() -> get local uri if available -> BackgroundAudioPlayer.Track = track
